Code with Friends
=================

A mostly-hacked-together and not-really-complete realtime code editor built atop the imo api (plus a minimalist chat client).

Expect bugs, and a lot of console.logs and really weird code hacks. If you can make it through all that, though, there are some pretty sweet ideas and a lot of useful snippets for your next weekend hack.


Have fun and happy hacking
